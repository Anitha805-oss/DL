# Deep Learning Lab – CIFAR-10 Image Classification

## Objective
To build and evaluate a VGG-16 deep learning model for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Dataset
- CIFAR-10 dataset
- 60,000 color images (32×32)
- 10 classes

## Steps Performed
1. Imported required libraries
2. Loaded CIFAR-10 dataset
3. Preprocessed images (normalization & one-hot encoding)
4. Built VGG-16 model
5. Trained the model
6. Evaluated performance using accuracy and loss
7. Plotted accuracy and loss curves
8. Generated confusion matrix

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## File
- `DL_Lab.ipynb` – complete implementation
